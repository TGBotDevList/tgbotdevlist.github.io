# About Me

John Doe is just a placeholder and has no life. You instead may introduce yourself here in a short paragraph.

# Coding Interests

John Doe is mostly interested in bots that have a search functionality via the inline mode. He uses userbots only when strictly necessary. How about you?

# Conditions

If you have some conditions for commissions that apply generally, list them here. E.g. 

* 25 Schekel/hours
* Fixed prices for bots with up to 5 commands without 3rd-party integrations
* Maybe you even have a contract template that you can link here?
